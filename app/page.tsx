            <span className="font-medium">Kiko Network is a decentralized, user-powered climate monitoring system that leverages a dense network of mobile weather stations deployed on delivery bikes, personal vehicles, and other moving assets.</span> </p>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">  
          Unlike traditional weather monitoring, which relies on sparse government or private stations, Kiko creates a hyperlocal, high-frequency data stream by crowdsourcing environmental data collection.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Our platform provides real-time, street-level insights on temperature, humidity, air quality, and other critical weather metrics, making it valuable for industries like logistics, ride-sharing, insurance, agriculture, and disaster management. 
          By integrating blockchain-based incentives, contributors who deploy and maintain Kiko nodes earn rewards, ensuring sustainable network growth and data reliability.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Our long-term vision is to create a decentralized climate intelligence layer, reshaping how weather data is collected, shared, and monetized globally.
